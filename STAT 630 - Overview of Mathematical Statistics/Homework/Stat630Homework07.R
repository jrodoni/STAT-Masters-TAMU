# 1.)  Chapter 4 Exercise 4.2.12.  Note:Mn= ??Xn=(1/n)*(X1+иии+Xn), the mean of 
# a sample of n data. Use R to generate the random exponential variables with rexp.
# The second argument for rexp(a value that you provide) is the parameter ?? in the 
# book's notation.  The mean of a vector x is given by mean(x).

# CHP 4 Exercise 4.2.12:
#   Generate i.i.d. X1,..., Xn distributed Exponential(5) and compute Mn when
#   n = 20. Repeat this N times, where N is large (if possible, take N = 10^5, otherwise
#   as large as is feasible), and compute the proportion of values of Mn that lie between
#   0.19 and 0.21. Repeat this with n = 50. What property of convergence in probability
#   do your results illustrate?

# first n customers,when n= 16, 36, 100.  (Hint:  use the mgf.)  Then use the 
# pgamma function in R to find the exact probability and compare it to the normal 
# approximation.

# CHP 4 Exercise 4.4.12:
#   Suppose the service time, in minutes, at a bank has the Exponential distribution
#   with ?? = 1/2. Use the central limit theorem to estimate the probability that the average
#   service time of the first n customers is less than 2.5 minutes, when

# 10.) Use R to simulate N=10^4 random samples (Z1,...,Zn) from the normal(0,1) distribution 
#      and compute T= max(Z1,...,Zn) for each sample. Use n= 20 (but you can try larger n for 
#      comparison, if you have time and would like to.) max(x) gets the maximum value in a 
#      vector x. Use hist and boxplot to obtain a histogram and box-plot of your N values 
#      of T. Comment on the histogram shape and symmetry.
